                  <p>Māori brought with them dogs and rats, yams kumara and gourds. The Māori also ate fern roots, however New Zealand had an abundance of seafood and bird life.

                  <p>Māori society was tribal. Each person belonged to a family (whanau), a sub tribe (hapu) and the full tribe (iwi). Warfare was common in New Zealand in these early days. The Māori built fortified settlements called pa and fought with long wooden clubs called taiaha and short wooden clubs called patu. They also fought with short jade clubs called mere.

                  <p>The Māori are famous for their carving, working with wood, bone and Jade (Paunamu). The Māori are also famous for their tattoos or moko, which were made with a bone chisel, a mallet and blue pigment.</p>

                  <h2>Early Europeans</h2>
                  <p>It was 127 years before New Zealand was visited by another European. Captain James Cook, on his ship the Endeavour, arrived in 1769 for the first of three voyages. Cooks first encounters with Māori were violent, however he went on to circumnavigate New Zealand and accurately map it.</p>
                  <p>European sealers started visiting regularly towards the end of the 18th century and whalers at the beginning of the 19th century, followed by traders. In the early 19th century some Europeans began buying land from the Māori. The Māori traded food and flax for European goods, including muskets. Muskets led to bloodier warfare between Māori and Europeans. The musket wars were fought between 1819 and 1825.</p>
                  <p>In 1840 William Hobson persuaded Māori to accept annexation by the Treaty of Waitangi, eventually signed by 500 Māori Chiefs. Māori accepted the sovereignty of the British crown, in return Māori became British subjects and were guaranteed possession of their land. In 1840 Hobson also made Auckland the capital.</p>
                  <p>In 1856 New Zealand was granted self-government and Wellington was made the capital in 1865. In the 1860's gold was discovered, resulting in the gold rushes.</p>
                  <p>Māori suffered from diseases introduced by Europeans and their numbers declined drastically. In 1769, when Cook arrived, there were about 100,000 Māori. By 1896 their numbers had fallen to 42,000. In contrast, the white population of New Zealand grew at a tremendous rate. By 1861 the population was almost 100,000, by 1881 it was nearly 500,000.</p>
                  <p>In 1860 simmering Māori resentment broke out into war. The fighting dragged on until 1872. As a result of the war, large amounts of land was confiscated from rebel tribes.</p>
                  <p>Late in the 19th century a number of reforms were created in New Zealand.
                  <ul>
                    <li>1877 - all men were granted the vote.</li>
                    <li>1893 - women were allowed to vote. (New Zealand was the first country in the world to allow women to vote in national elections).</li>
                    <li>1877 - free, compulsory education was introduced.</li>
                    <li>1894 - compulsory state arbitration labour disputes was introduced.</li>
                    <li>1898 - old age pensions were created.</li>

                <p class="text">On 6th February 1840 in the Bay of Islands, more than 40 Māori chiefs signed a treaty with the British Crown. The ‘Treaty of Waitangi’ remains controversial to this day.</p>

                  <h2>The Treaty of Waitangi</h2>
                  <p>With instructions from the Colonial Office in London to seek Māori consent to British sovereignty, Captain William Hobson set out to present a treaty document to a hui of prominent Māori chiefs. Missionary Henry Williams and his son Edward translated the English draft into Māori on the night of 4th February. The Treaty comprised of three clauses.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Transfer kawanatanga (governorship) from the Confederation and individual chiefs to Queen Victoria.</li>
                    <li>Guarantee Māori continued possession of their taonga (property), with the right to sell land to the Crown should they wish.</li>
                    <li>Grant Māori the ‘rights and privileges’ of British subjects.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>On the morning of 5th February, about 500 Māori, Hobson’s council and local Pākehā gathered on the lawn in front of British Resident James Busby’s house at Waitangi. After Hobson spoke in English, Henry Williams explained in Māori that the treaty was an act of love by the Queen and Busby emphasised that it protected land rights.</p>
                  <p>Much of the subsequent kōrero translated for Hobson by the missionaries favoured the status quo, with missionaries rather than a governor as protectors of Māori. Some chiefs also foresaw the loss of their land. The tide was turned by two influential rangatira, with Tāmati Wāka Nene declaring it was too late to stop Pākehā arriving and Hōne Heke Pōkai advocating a covenant between Māori and the Queen.</p>
                  <p>Informal debate continued that evening. Hobson had announced that the hui would reconvene on the 7th, but many chiefs were eager to leave for home. When they assembled outside Busby’s residence on the morning of the 6th, Hobson was summoned hastily from the Herald to accept signatures. By September 1840, another 500 Māori had signed one of the nine copies of the treaty and British sovereignty over the whole country had been declared.</p>

                  <p>Although essentially of Western culture, New Zealand has a very unique and dynamic culture. The culture of its indigenous Māori people influences the language, the arts, and even the accents of all New Zealanders.

                  <p>Culturally New Zealand has become more diverse. Particularly from the 1980s, a wide range of ethnic groups have been encouraged to settle and New Zealand is now much more multicultural.</p>
                  <p>
                  According to data from the most recent national Census (2013), 25% of people living in New Zealand are born abroad. 15% are Māori, over 12% are Asian and over 7% are from Pacific Islands nations. Hindi is now the fourth most common language in New Zealand, after English, Māori, and Samoan.</p>
                  <p>New Zealand's indigenous Māori people have a unique and fascinating language and culture, which plays a major role in New Zealand life.</p>
                  <p>Though a diverse and multicultural people, there are many qualities including friendliness, individuality, innovation and self-reliance that you'll find in most New Zealanders. "It's our national character!"</p>
                  <p>The influence of Māori, Pacific Island, European and Asian cultures makes the arts in New Zealand colourful, unique and vibrant - definitely something to look out for!</p>
                  <p>A range of wacky and weird objects helps define what it is to be a New Zealander, or 'Kiwi'. These wonderful things are known simply as 'Kiwiana'. Many citizens prefer to minimise ethnic divisions, simply calling themselves New Zealanders or Kiwis.</p>

            <h2>About New Zealand</h2>
            <p>New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, made up of two main islands; the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui), the South Island (Te Waipounamu) and around 600 smaller islands. New Zealand is situated 1,500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1,000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga.</p>
            <p>Because of its remoteness, New Zealand was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation it developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.</p>
            <p>New Zealand is a developed country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom and quality of life. Since the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from a predominantly agricultural based economy to a market economy.</p>
            <p>Nationally New Zealand has an elected democratic government, while political decisions are exercised by the Cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, who is currently Bill English. Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general. New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes.
            <p>The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.</p>
