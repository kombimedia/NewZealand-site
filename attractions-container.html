                  <p>In the heart of New Zealand, you can step into the lush pastures of the Shire™, as featured in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies.</p>
                  <p>Hobbiton™ Movie Set is an experience to tantalise the senses of visitors from all across the globe, as guests find themselves engulfed in the sights, smells, sounds and tastes of The Shire™, at the home of the Hobbits™, as featured in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Trilogies.</p>
                  <p>The extraordinary following that the movies have amassed has led to our tours becoming a must see while travellers are in New Zealand. The Hobbiton Movie Set is the only set that remains intact from the trilogies, and that allows our visitors to fully immerse themselves in the wonders of The Shire.</p>
                  <p>Visitors are given the once in a lifetime opportunity to see an iconic movie set in its full glory; from wandering the rambling paths of The Shire, to seeing the submerged Hobbit Holes™ that litter the rolling hillsides.</p>
                  <p>Fall in love with the Alexander family sheep farm, just as acclaimed director Sir Peter Jackson did, as you journey through the unequivocal beauty of the land, with the mighty Kaimai Ranges towering in the distance. Your guide will then escort you around the set, showing you the intricate detailing, pointing out the most famous locations and explaining how the movie magic was made.</p>
                  <p>You will be taken around the 12 acre set; past Hobbit Holes, the Mill and into the world-famous Green Dragon™ Inn, where you can sample our exclusive, specially brewed beverages to conclude your own Middle-earth adventure.</p>
                  <p>Evening Banquet Tours are also available for the hungry traveller. Experience Hobbiton Movie Set as you have never seen it before with a guided tour through The Shire at dusk. Your guide escorts you through the 12 acre site, recounting fascinating stories and anecdotes about the trilogies. The tour concludes at The Green Dragon Inn where you will be treated to a banquet feast fit for a Hobbit. The tables will be heaving with traditional Hobbit fayre and, as is the tradition in the Shire, second helpings are encouraged.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this premium Hobbiton Movie Set experience, after dinner the guests will re-join their guide to make their way back through the wandering paths of The Shire.</p>

                  <h2>Tongariro National Park</h2>
                  <p>Tongariro National Park is one of three World Heritage sites in New Zealand. The other two are Te Wahipounamu in the South Island, and the Sub Antarctic Islands.</p>
                  <p>Tongariro was nominated for both natural and cultural World Heritage status in 1990, and was inscribed on the heritage list that year for its natural values. At that time the criteria for cultural World Heritage sites stipulated that there be some tangible evidence of cultural use of the site e.g. a temple, habitation, etc.</p>
                  <p>
                  <p>The most popular activity in the park is the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. The Track crosses stark and spectacular volcanic terrain, traversing between Mt Ngauruhoe and Mt Tongariro. Among its highlights are steaming vents and hot springs, old lava flows, beautiful water-filled explosion craters and stunning views. On clear days you can see Mount Taranaki in the west, Mount Ngauruhoe, the Kaimanawa Ranges, Lake Taupo and beyond.</p>

An easy two-hour drive north of Christchurch, Kaikoura makes for a great day trip or a fun stop on your way to Marlborough.</p>
                  <p>Kaikoura's environment is truly spectacular – the village is caught between the rugged Seaward Kaikoura Range and the Pacific Ocean. In winter the mountains are covered with snow, adding to the drama of the landscape.</p>
                  <p>Kaikoura’s special talent is marine mammal encounters – whales, fur seals and dolphins live permanently in the coastal waters. Whale watching trips leave the town several times a day and the local seal colony is always entertaining. There are plenty of cafés, restaurants and shops to explore.</p>
                  <h4>Must-do activities in Kaikoura</h4>

                  <p>Bounded by steep cliffs and dense rainforest, Milford Sound is by far the best known of all of the fiords in New Zealand, and the only one that can be accessed by road. Rain or shine, Milford Sound continues to captivate even the most experienced traveller. At the pinnacle of Milford Sound is the iconic Mitre Peak - standing a proud 1,692 metres above sea level, it is certainly an impressive sight to behold.  It is approximately 16km from the head of the fiord to the open sea, which means visitors can comfortably travel the length of the fiord to open ocean and return on one of the many cruise options.</p>

                  <h2>Kaikoura</h2>
                  <p>Kaikoura is a base for wildlife experiences of all kinds. It’s also a great place to eat crayfish (in the Maori language 'kai' means food, 'koura' means crayfish). An easy two-hour drive north of Christchurch, Kaikoura makes for a great day trip or a fun stop on your way to Marlborough.</p>
                  <p>Kaikoura's environment is truly spectacular – the village is caught between the rugged Seaward Kaikoura Range and the Pacific Ocean. In winter the mountains are covered with snow, adding to the drama of the landscape.</p>
                  <p>Kaikoura’s special talent is marine mammal encounters – whales, fur seals and dolphins live permanently in the coastal waters. Whale watching trips leave the town several times a day and the local seal colony is always entertaining. There are plenty of cafés, restaurants and shops to explore.</p>
                  <h4>Must-do activities in Kaikoura</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Go whale-watching by boat or air at any time of the year.</li>
                    <li>Swim with or simply watch beautiful dusky dolphins on a dolphin encounter.</li>
                    <li>Experience seal swimming with the playful New Zealand fur seals in the shallow waters of the beautiful Kaikoura Peninsula.</li>
                    <li>Take a bird watching tour to view seabirds, albatross, molly-mawks, petrels and many more.</li>
                    <li>Hike the Kaikoura Peninsula Walkway - three hours return to visit a seal colony, limestone formations and a seabird colony.</li>
                    <li>Visit Fyffe House, a colonial whaler's cottage.</li>
                    <li>Meet the local indigenous people and experience Māori culture with Māori Tours Kaikoura.</li>

                  <h2>Queenstown</h2>
                  <p>Sitting on the shore of crystal clear Lake Wakatipu, surrounded by majestic mountains is Queenstown - the Southern Hemisphere’s premier four season lake and alpine resort. Recognized as New Zealand's premier visitor destination.
                  The lake and mountain landscape make it suited to all kinds of adventure.
                  Queenstown has the reputation of being the ‘Adventure Capital of the world’. There’s skiing in the winter and adrenalin activities such as bungy jumping, sky diving, canyon swinging, jet boating and river rafting all year round.
                  There are plenty of relaxing things to see and do as well, such as horse trekking, hiking and sightseeing or indulging yourself with spa treatments, boutique shopping and excellent food and wine.</p>
                  <p>Queenstown has a well-deserved reputation as the adventure capital of New Zealand. Bungy jumping and the Shotover Jet have become iconic activities, but there’s so much more on offer. Skiing is another huge attraction, with a range of top class fields within easy reach. Those looking for a more relaxed experience can soak in a hot pool or take in the jaw-dropping scenery on a lake cruise.</p>

            <h2>New Zealand - a destination</h2>
            <p>The North Island combines natural beauty with city style in a mild climate; perfect whether you’re seeking a beach holiday, an authentic cultural experience or retail therapy. Many New Zealand journeys begin in Auckland, but take the time to explore a surprisingly wide range of destinations outside the big city.</p>
            <p>Northland, New Zealand is a subtropical haven of beaches, islands and bays, native rainforest and is culturally significant, being New Zealand’s first area of settlement.
            The Northland Region stretches from Auckland to the very top of New Zealand. It is a story of two coastlines with the iconic Bay of Islands, as well as the Kauri Coast, the Far North, and Whangarei.
            Encounter the magnificent Tane Mahuta, the biggest kauri tree in existence, amongst New Zealand rainforest near the stunning Hokianga harbour. Journey past the huge sand dunes and pristine beaches of the Far North to experience the northernmost tip of the country, where you can watch the seas of the Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea collide.
            Visit the stunning Doubtless Bay and then the beautiful Bay of Islands with its 144 islands and bays. Swim with dolphins, dive, fish, sail or play golf and visit the Waitangai Treaty Grounds, one of New Zealand’s most significant historic sites, along with Russell and Kerikeri, New Zealand's oldest settlements and buildings.
            Northland's only city, Whangarei is close to the beautiful Bream Bay and Mangawhai beaches to the south, and Tutukaka with a world class marine reserve for diving and fantastic outlying marlin fishing areas.</p>
            <p>From forest-fringed beaches to soaring mountains, the scenery of the South Island is an unforgettable backdrop to adrenaline-pumping adventure and indulgent relaxation. But did you know that in addition to its famous landscapes, the South Island is also home to rich cultural heritage and fascinating cities?</p>
            <p>New Zealand’s South Island with its dramatic scenery of pure natural landscapes is set to awe you every step of the way.
            Although the South Island is the larger of the two main islands of New Zealand, it is less densely populated with large areas of untouched natural beauty.
            Renowned by many as the world's best adventure playground, there is so much to see and do set against a stunning backdrop of untouched forest, snow-capped mountains and rugged beaches. Marine, bird and other wildlife are plentiful throughout the Island.
            The largest city in the South Island is Christchurch, known as the 'Garden City' because of its many stunningly beautiful gardens, and its tree-lined streets. Queenstown is also found in the South Island of New Zealand, world famous as a premier four-season retreat.</p>
