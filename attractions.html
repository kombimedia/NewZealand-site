                  <h2>Milford Sound</h2>
                  <p>From the fiords dark waters rise vertical cliffs with waterfalls, some as high as 1000 metres, cascading down them. The magnetising Mitre Peak stands proud at 1,692 metres above sea level; it is certainly an impressive sight to behold. There is so much to see and do in this awe inspiring area, take a cruise, kayak, dive or even fly!</p>
                  <p>Bounded by steep cliffs and dense rainforest, Milford Sound is by far the best known of all of the fiords in New Zealand, and the only one that can be accessed by road. Rain or shine, Milford Sound continues to captivate even the most experienced traveler.</p>
                  <p>It is approximately 16km from the head of the fiord to the open sea, meaning visitors can comfortably travel the length of the fiord to open ocean and return on one of the many cruise options.</p>

            <h3>North Island</h3>
            <p>New Zealand's North Island combines natural beauty with city style in a mild climate; perfect whether if you’re seeking a beach holiday, an authentic cultural experience or retail therapy.

            From the far north where New Zealand’s political history began, journey through landscapes that blend magnificent beaches, sprawling farmlands and geothermal wonders. Maori culture is rich and ever-present in many parts of the North Island.</p>
            <p>Explore the country's fertile heartland, showcasing lush forests, rugged mountains, and steep gorges. Get off the beaten track and you'll be richly rewarded.</p>
            <h3>South Island</h3>
            <p>From forest-fringed beaches to soaring mountains, the scenery of the South Island is an unforgettable backdrop to adrenaline-pumping adventure and indulgent relaxation. But did you know that in addition to its famous landscapes, the South Island is also home to rich cultural heritage and fascinating cities?</p>
            <p>New Zealand’s South Island hosts the purest natural landscapes you’ll ever experience.
            From wildlife to wineries, from glacial valleys to star-filled skies, nature's best flourishes against a palette of dramatic scenes. Towering alps meet peaceful sounds and rugged coastlines merge with sweeping plains. Let’s not forget the backbone of the island - the most down-to-earth locals you’ll ever meet. Venture to the South Island and you'll be met by lofty mountains, fiords and glaciers – the landscapes here are famous the world over.</p>
